# Vanadium Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/razvanm/vanadium-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/razvanm/vanadium-core)

This is a slimmed down version of Vanadium that is focused on its RPCs system.
Building doesn't require the `jiri` tool and everything is on git repository.
